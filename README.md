## 📱 About the App

LumiSmart is an Android-based application designed to monitor and control intelligent streetlights in real-time. It offers a visually intuitive dashboard for city operators to manage lighting systems efficiently, reduce energy consumption, and respond to faults quickly. Using smart sensors, the system ensures that only the necessary streetlights remain active—reducing power waste without compromising safety.
